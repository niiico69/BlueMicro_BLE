# BlueMicro Firmware  [![Current Version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/jpconstantineau/BlueMicro_BLE)](https://github.com/jpconstantineau/BlueMicro_BLE/tags)  ![Build on Docker](https://github.com/jpconstantineau/BlueMicro_BLE/workflows/Build%20on%20Docker/badge.svg)

**A Keyboard Firmware for nRF52832 and nRF52840 Boards**

BlueMicro_BLE is a keyboard firmware that builds on top the Adafruit nRF52 board support package (BSP) for their line of Adafruit nRF52 Feather Boards.

By starting with the simple hid_keyboard.ino example provided with the Arduino board support package, we expanded it to a full blown Keyboard firmware with lots of features.

# Contributing

We're very happy to have your contributions in BlueMicro_BLE Firmware

**Contributing New Features**: First, make sure you've run a full set of builds for all boards if adding new functionality (./build.ps1 all). This will ensure that the new functionality doesn't break the build of other keyboards.  Then, make a pull request to this repo. Thanks!

**Adding a new keyboard**: First, add your new keyboard to the folder structure.  You will need to create the apropriate folders and place the 4 necessary keyboard files.  Then, make sure you've run a build for all keymaps applicable to your keyboard (./build.ps1 keyboardname). This will ensure that your keymap can support future hardware configurations.  Then, make a pull request to this repo. Thanks!
